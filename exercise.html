        <b>Dogs Need Exercise</b>
    </h1>
    <p>
        Dogs need <i>(and love)</i> to exercise.  On this page we will go over a few different forms of exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first type of exercise that will be covered is physical exercise.  This can be the classic "walk".  Most dogs live in houses (or apartments) with 
        small yards or spaces.  No matter what size your companion is, a walk around the block is much needed for them to stretch their legs.  Picking up the pace 
        is much needed for their cardiovascular health and muscle development.  A better solution is to take your dog to a dog park to let them off the leash.  It
        always amazes me at how fast and far my dog will go when the leash is let off!

        The second form of exercise is playful exercise.  Many dogs love to rough house.  The activity that comes to mind is tug of war.  Not only will it get your dog's 
        heart pumping, but it can also be good for their teeth!  Getting your dog all riled up is good for them to unlock their deeply rooted instincts to fight for what 
        is theirs.  It also is one of the fastest ways to tire a restless dog out as well!  The quick burst of maximum effort activity is a sure fire way to ensure that 
        they will get a good nights sleep.

        The third form of exercise is task exercise.  Some dogs instinctively are good at tasks.  A golden retriever wants to do one thing all day long, and that is to 
        retrieve!  For this form of exercise think about what your dog is naturally good at and let them do it.  They will view this as their job and will want to continue
        doing it until they are spent for the day.  The activities that come to mind for task exercise are hide and seek, herding (yes you can play a herding game!), and the 
        classic fetch.
