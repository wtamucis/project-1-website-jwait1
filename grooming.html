    Dogs need to be groomed much like humans do.  THe <i>three</i> grooming aspects we will discuss are bathing, nail trimming, and furr trimming.
</p>
<p>
    First dogs need to be bathed regularly.  How regularly depends on your furry friend.  Mine likes to spend a lot of time outdoors, and if not  
    bathed weekly can get out of hand fast.  Sometimes it is tough to gauge the frequency of bathing regimen required, but my general rule of thumb
    is to bath approximatley every two weeks.  If your dog likes to play in puddles, you may want to change that to every week.  If your dog likes to 
    roll around in the mud (like mine); I hope you enjoy giving your dog a bath...
</p>

    Next, dogs need their nails trimmed.  Just like humans, this is a very important aspect to grooming.  Dogs paws can have ingrown nails, and can become
    infected if not properly trimmed.  My general rule of paw is to trim them twice a year.  Some dogs love to have them trimmed and will let you do it for you.
    However, other dogs can be pests about it, and it may be better to take them to a proffessional for help.  If you have a pesky dog who does not like their nails
    trimmed; a quick tip is (weather permitting) to walk them on the side walk.  The concrete can and will file their nails done.  Two caveats with this advice.  First,
    only do this in cooler months.  Concrete can get very hot and burn your dogs paws.  Second, be mindful on how long you walk your dog on the concrete.  Concrete is typically
    corse and can hurt your pups paws.
</p>

    The final advice for grooming is the coveted furr trimming.  All dogs, short and long fur, need to have their coats trimmed at least once a year.  Our dog's is trimmed twice
    a year.  Once in the early spring we will have it cut back a little shorter, and once in the fall for a maintence cut.  Keepiing a well trimmed furr coat will help deter fleas
    and ticks.  With no place for these pesky insects to nest it is near impossible for them to thrive.  Not to mention a well maintained coat is easier to bathe!
