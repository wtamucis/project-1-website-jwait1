    <h1><b>Man's Best Friend</b></h1>
    <p>Dogs truly are man's best friend.  There is a reason that <i>wolves</i> (domesticated dog's ancestors) were originally domesticated.  Dog's are loyal, obediant, useful, and caring.
        It is in their DNA.  You rarely actually hear of a "lone wolf" in the wild.  They travel in packs.  They are used to being a family unit, and that is one of many reasons why 
        they (wolves) were able to coexist (in the long run) with humans.
    </p>
    <p>In the present day many homes have a canine companion, and the purpose of this site is to talk about various ways to keep your furry friend healthy.  The two topics covered will 
        be exercise and grooming.  Both of these are an absolute must to ensure that your dog will have not only a healthy life, but a fulfilling life.  Click on the exercising link to 
        learn more about physical exercise, playful exercise, & task exercise.  Clicking on the grooming link will take you to a page dedicated to proper bathing intervals, furr-cuts, &
        nail trimming.
